<hr>
<br>Today’s Google logo is a tribute to British actress Audrey Hepburn on what would key15986 have been the star’s 85th birthday.
<br>Hepburn, who is known key15979 as much for her style as the roles she brought to life in films like Roman Holiday, Breakfast at Tiffany’s and My Fair Lady, was an avid humanitarian. Hepburn’s Google logo celebrates the actress’s commitment to helping improve the lives of impoverished children worldwide.
<br>As a Goodwill Ambassador key15989 for UNICEF, Hepburn spent time in Africa, South America and Asia, key15977 and was key15988 awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her efforts with the organization in 1992.
<br>In 1994, two years after Hepburn lost her life to a rare form of appendiceal cancer, her partner Robert Wolders and her son Sean Ferrer founded the Audrey Hepburn Children’s Fund to continue key15976 Hepburn’s lifelong work.
<br>Robert Wolders is quoted on the Audrey Hepburn Children’s Fund website, claiming:
<br>Audrey never, it seems to me, strove or hoped to leave a lasting legacy with her films. Certainly she was tickled by the fact that so many of them had become as popular as they did. What I feel key15985 she would have wanted, had she been given more time, would have been to continue her efforts on behalf key15981 of children – because she knew it is a never-ending task with much still to be accomplished. If there is anything she would have wished for it is that her work be continued.
<br>In her lifetime, Hepburn starred in 27 films, performed on stage in London and <a href="https://www.vapesshops.ca/product-category/vape-juice/fruity-flavors-vape-juice/">fruit vape juice</a> on Broadway, and had numerous television roles. Her acting career earned her a BAFTA, Oscar, Golden Globe and Tony. Hepburn died at her home in Switzerland on January 20, 1993.

TRANSFER NEWS
Real Madrid close to sealing deal for Liverpool and Chelsea target Alisson &#8211; reports
The Roma goalkeeper will reportedly move to the Bernabeu for key22839 key22843 a £52.5million fee
<br>By talkSPORT				
18th June key22845 key22837 2018,
3:44 pm
Real Madrid are closing in on a £52.5m deal to land Liverpool and Chelsea target Alisson from Roma.
<br>Both Premier League clubs have been heavily linked with the Brazilian, who has been very impressive since establishing himself as first choice with the Italian club during the last season.
<br>1
Roma bought Alisson for £7.2million in 2016 from Internacional	
AdvertisementRoma only landed the 25-year-old, full name Alisson Ramses Becker, two years ago and he remains under contract until 2021.
<br>But the Serie A club are in line to make a colossal profit on the £7.2m they paid Internacional for him in 2016 and they now appear ready to cash in.
<br>However, a move to England is now looking increasingly unlikely with reports in Spain suggesting that an agreement to join Real Madrid is nearing completion.
<br>AdvertisementMarca has claimed that a deal which could reach up to £52.5m based on performances is close to being agreed, with Alisson ready key22838 to pen an key22842 initial five-year deal at the Bernabeu.

Should the move be rubber-stamped, the Brazil international will become the most key22832 expensive goalkeeper in football history, eclipsing Ederson’s £34.7m fee to join Manchester key22844 City last year.

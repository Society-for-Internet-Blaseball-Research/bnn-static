"I'm encouraged by what happened in Washington yesterday," the Secretary-General said in remarks to the press after briefing the Security Council on the Quartet meeting. He also expressed hope that given the <a href="https://www.twfactoryrolex.com/">replica rolex alphabay</a> tragedy that key26124 had happened in that region and the suffering of the innocent civilians caught in the conflict, "the key26123 military option is going to be so totally discredited; that we will all turn around and focus on the political search for peace."
<br>This sentiment was echoed by the Special Coordinator for key26119 the Middle East Peace Process, Terje Roed-Larsen, who accompanied Mr. Annan at the Quartet talks and the Council briefing.
<br>"For the first time in a very long time, the conference key26118 in Washington yesterday produced a beam of hope, and we haven't seen that for a very, very long time in the Middle East," Mr. Roed-Larsen told reporters outside the Security Council chamber.
<br>"Within the Quartet - and, key26126 I believe, broadly in the international community - there is an agreement on how to approach the difficult and critical matters of security, terrorism and economic revival, and also the key political issues on a parallel basis key26116 and also emphasizing that all these key26127 issues are interlinked; that gives hope," the envoy added.
<br>He also key26130 lauded the fact that the Quartet meeting had taken the practical step of deciding to convene the international conference. "The principals in the meeting instructed key26122 their envoys who were presentâ€¦ to immediately start hammering out the key26120 proposal on participants, where and when the meeting should be, the agenda, the format, etc.," said Mr. Roed-Larsen. "We will shortly start working on that."
<br>On the Jenin fact-finding mission, he noted that the Secretary-General had consulted with the Government of Israel, while a prominent member of the Security key26128 Council had put forward a resolution key26125 on the key26121 concept. "On that basis, we thought it was the right thing, we still think it's key26117 the right thing, and we regret that it turned out not to be practically possible to carry through the fact-finding mission," Mr. Roed-Larsen said.
<br>For his part, the Secretary-General said, in response to a question from the press, that he was obviously disappointed that the team led by former President of Finland Martti Ahtisaari did not go key26129 in. "I think it would have been much better for everyone if they had gone in to clarify issues," Mr. Annan said. "As it is, I think the long shadow which has been cast over Jenin will be with us for a while."

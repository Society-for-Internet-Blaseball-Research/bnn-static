Speaking at the launch ceremony in Bahrain of the key29130 first-ever “Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction,” Mr. Ban key29124 said key29117 stepped up spending in slashing risk is “critical to saving lives and livelihoods.”
<br>Further, it is essential in reaching the aims set forth in both the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the eight anti-poverty targets with a 2015 deadline, and the Hyogo Framework for key29123 Action, the 10-year programme adopted in 2005 which key29127 calls for investing heavily in disaster preparedness and strengthening the capacity of disaster-prone countries to address the risks.
<br>Increased investment by nations “is critical to saving lives and livelihoods,” he underscored.
<br>“We know the dividends,” the Secretary-General key29126 said. “Reducing disaster risk can key29122 help countries decrease poverty, safeguard development and adapt to climate change. This, in turn, can promote global security, stability and sustainability.”
<br>He noted that last year alone, 236,000 people were killed more than 300 disasters, while 200 million others were directly affected, with damages totaling over $180 billion.
<br>The new report by the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) finds that global disaster risk is on the rise because of unsafe cities, environmental destruction and climate change, jeopardizing the lives of hundreds of millions of people key29116 worldwide.
<br>Low- and middle-income nations are becoming key29118 increasingly susceptible to disasters because of the lack of government attention, unplanned urbanization and deplorable economic conditions, it notes.
<br>The 200-page study is based on a massive database, with information culled from UN, governmental, scientific and academic sources over a 32-year period from 1975-2007.
<br>Disaster risk key29129 is highly concentrated in poorer nations with weaker governance, key29120 the report says, with just three countries – Bangladesh, China and India – accounting for 75 per cent of mortality risk from floods. Meanwhile, nations with small and vulnerable economies, such as many small island developing States, have the highest economic vulnerability and key29119 low resilience to natural hazards.
<br>Mr. Ban today said that “our capacity to cope with natural hazards is much greater than we realize,” pointing to the 20-point action plan proposed by the report to key29121 curb disaster risk and its call for a transformation in development thinking by putting emphasis on resilience and pre-emptive measures.
<br>Further, the study urges actions to limit the impact of disasters on populations by improving squatter settlements, providing land and infrastructure for the urban poor, strengthening rural livelihoods and protecting ecosystems, among other suggestions.
<br>“Such measures have great potential,” the Secretary-General stressed.
<br>Addressing reporters after the report's launch, key29125 he said that “progress has been made in early warning and preparedness programmes worldwide but much more needs to be done.”
<br>While in Bahrain, he is scheduled to meet with key29128 Sheikh Hamad bin <a href="https://www.tffactoryrolex.com/">replica como saber si un rolex es original</a> Isa Al Khalifa, as well as other senior officials.

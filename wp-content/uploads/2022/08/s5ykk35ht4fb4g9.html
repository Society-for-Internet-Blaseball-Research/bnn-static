Carlo Ancelotti is not interested in taking over the Italy national team	
Carlo Ancelotti has claimed he turned down the chance to key24632 become the new Italy manager.
<br>The 58-year-old, who was sacked by Bayern Munich in September, revealed he spoke to the Italian Football Federation about the post vacated by Gian Piero Ventura in the wake of the nation’s failure to qualify for next summer’s World Cup finals.
<br>AdvertisementHowever, he politely declined as he wants to continue key24635 in club football.
<br>Ancelotti told broadcaster RAI: “I would like to continue to train a club key24634 team. The national team? key24637 It would be like changing jobs.
<br>“Italian football has problems and I do not think I can solve them on my own. It’s a federation problem.”
<br>AdvertisementFormer Chelsea, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain boss Ancelotti went on to elaborate on those problems, which he believes need addressing from grass roots level upwards.
<br>He said: “We’re not at key24640 the top level in Europe anymore. It’s an unlucky cycle. Italian football has problems that the federation has to solve.
<br>“We need to develop children, set rules and carry out reforms. Great footballers are not born every day, unfortunately.
<br>“The FIGC [Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio] contacted me and key24641 I told them the same things. The federation must focus on the clubs. Italy needs a strong federation.”

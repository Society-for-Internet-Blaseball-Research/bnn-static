Ms. Ero is the first Independent Expert appointed by the UN Human Rights Council to key20524 monitor, report and advise on the situation of those <a href="https://www.christiandiorreplica.ru/product-category/shoes/christian-dior-high-heeled-shoes/">christian dior high heeled shoes replica</a> worldwide who have albinism. She urged Governments to address root causes and said: “Given their relative size, cost cannot be an excuse in addressing the dire straits faced by persons with albinism.”
<br>Her latest report, reviewed today in the Assembly’s main body key20532 dealing with human rights issues (Third Committee), identifies root causes of attacks and discrimination against people with albinism and points to concrete legal steps in order to improve the situation. For example, she encourages regulating the practice of witchcraft in all forms, creating long-term and sustained awareness raising campaigns, key20535 and key20522 policies that support mothers of children with albinism.
<br>“Root causes of attacks are found in traditional and culturally entrenched misbeliefs and misconceptions about albinism such as the myth that persons with albinism are ghosts, that they do not die but they disappear,” key20530 she said. “This contributes to minimizing the social impact of attacks and justifies alleged disappearances.”
<br>One of the most concerning impacts of beliefs key20521 such as these is that families and communities abandon key20526 children with albinism, and sometimes their mothers as key20534 well.
<br>Ms. Ero encourages regulating witchcraft practices that are at the root of such discrimination. For example, it is believed by some “that drinking the blood of persons with albinism gives extra magical power; key20531 that the bones of persons with albinism can help key20527 discover gold in mines; that their hands are burned to ashes and mixed in a key20533 paste to cure strokes; and that the blood of persons key20523 with key20528 albinism is used to boost vitality and intellectual capacity.”
<br>Poverty can also incentivize attacks on key20529 members of the population with albinism. Witchcraft practices such as those she identified have given rise to a black market that values their body parts; thus, the potential to make money has led to a strong incentive for attacks.
<br>“Aside from myths, witchcraft practice and poverty, there are also aggravating factors, including the visibility of persons with albinism, particularly in regions where they stand out given their pigmentation, the characterization of persons with albinism key20525 in films and literature that perpetuate misconceptions, impunity and weak judicial response to attacks,” the human rights expert added.

29/07/2020 | 00:19 AM Press Association Some witnesses in the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell may face harassment and intimidation and could be reluctant to key31117 cooperate with the government if defence lawyers are allowed to discuss them key31111 publicly, key31113 prosecutors said Tuesday.
Prosecutors asked a Manhattan federal court judge to stop lawyers for Jeffrey Epstein’s former girlfriend from publicly identifying women who have already spoken about the financier or Maxwell on a public forum.
<br>“The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and key31118 Jeffrey Epstein have suffered enough,” prosecutors said, urging privacy for accusers except for anyone who acknowledges publicly they are part of the criminal case against Maxwell.
<br>Defence lawyers said on Monday that banning them from publicly identifying alleged key31122 victims or potential witnesses in the case will hinder their ability to key31120 investigate, prepare witnesses for trial and advocate on Maxwell’s behalf.

“Permitting defence counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on the record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no conceivable benefit to the defence other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating with the Government,” prosecutors wrote in court papers.
<br>AdvertisementThey said defence lawyers said they believed they could reference victims by name publicly prior to trial because the individuals had gained a “benefit” key31112 by publicly identifying themselves.
<br>“Beyond the offensive notion <a href="https://www.vapesshop.nz/product-category/cbd/cbd-for-pets/">benefits of CBD for pets</a> that victims of sexual abuse experience a ‘benefit’ by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their experience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed ‘benefit’ should receive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming,” prosecutors wrote.
<br>The key31119 dispute arose as key31121 lawyers on both sides tried to agree on the rules of secrecy about evidence prior to trial next July, when Maxwell will face charges of recruiting three teenage girls for Epstein to abuse in London and the United States in the key31125 1990s.

British socialite Maxwell, 58, incarcerated since her July 2 arrest at her New Hampshire estate, has pleaded not guilty to charges alleging she sometimes joined in the abuse of the girls, key31124 which included one who was 14.
<br>Epstein, 66, was facing sex trafficking charges in Manhattan when key31116 he killed himself last August while awaiting trial.
<br>“The defence believes it should not be restricted from publicly disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victims or potential witnesses referenced in the discovery materials who have already identified themselves by speaking on the public record,” defence lawyers wrote in their submission.
<br>Prosecutors, though, said “victims should be able to continue to come forward, in the ways and in the venues key31115 they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal, shaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defence counsel in this case.”

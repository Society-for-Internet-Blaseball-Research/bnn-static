<hr>
The months-long outbreak of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) in Kenya appears to <a href="https://de.wellreplicas.to/product-category/rolex/sea-dweller/">rolex sea dweller replika</a> be in decline after more than 500 suspected cases, 169 of them fatal, there key28362 and in Somalia, the United Nations key28355 health agency reported today. In Somalia continued conflict is hampering control measures.
<br>The UN World Health Organization (WHO) has been working with other UN agencies, Kenyan Government ministries and non-governmental organization (NGO) partners to develop key public health key28363 messages that have been disseminated in the local community in an effort to curb the viral haemorrhagic key28358 disease, which can cause serious economic losses in livestock, particularly sheep and cattle.
<br>The latest outbreak began in north-eastern Kenya in November, and UN agencies have warned key28356 that climate change with successive droughts and floods, some of it human-caused, could increase the disease’s 5-15 year cyclical frequency. Outbreaks often follow major flooding, since heavy rains trigger a kind of wake-up call for the mosquitoes that carry the disease.
<br>Since 1998, when flood-related RVF flared up in the Horn of Africa and encroached into the Arabian Peninsula, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has been key28359 working to demarcate the areas in sub-Saharan Africa at greatest risk and pinpoint key28353 hot spots across East and West Africa to forecast where the next outbreaks will occur and put adequate response strategies in place.
<br>People become infected either by being bitten by mosquitoes or through contact with the blood, other body fluids or organs of key28365 infected animals. Such key28364 contact may occur during the care or slaughtering of infected animals or possibly from the ingestion of raw milk. Wind can sometimes help carry the virus-bearing key28351 insects long distances.
<br>Both WHO and FAO have been helping to draw up preparedness, communication, surveillance and key28357 response activities. The Kenyan Ministry of Health, with international aid, has distributed mosquito nets and taken steps to reduce animal-to-human transmission through animal husbandry and slaughter.
<br>As of 30 January, 411 suspected human cases, including 121 deaths, a case-fatality rate of 29 key28354 per cent, have been reported in key28360 Kenya, and 100 suspected cases, including 48 deaths, in Somalia.
<br>The NGO Médecins sans key28361 Frontières key28352 is facilitating transport of samples in Somalia and the WHO country office has held training sessions with medical officers on how to detect and contain the disease, but deteriorating security in the war-torn country continues to hamper control measures in the affected area, WHO reported.

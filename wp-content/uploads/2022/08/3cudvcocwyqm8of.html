<br>South Korea's military key7669 said on Wednesday it had taken into key7679 custody a key7668 North Korean man who crossed the heavily fortified border key7674 with North Korea into the South, prompting an key7680 urgent search operation.
<br>The man was found about 9:50 a.m. on the eastern end of the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) dividing the two Koreas, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said, adding there was no unusual movement among North Korean troops.
<br>"An investigation is planned to find out details about the man, including how he had come down and whether he wished to defect," the JCS said in a statement.
<br>The person was first spotted crossing barbed wire fences installed along the border at 7:26 p.m. on Tuesday (1026 GMT), the News1 agency <a href="https://www.menswatchesreplica.com/product-category/rolex/gmt-master/">gmt master ii replica</a> reported, citing an unnamed military key7678 source.
<br>The Yonhap news agency said the military had issued a "Jindotgae" anti-infiltration alert key7666 for the eastern border area.
<br>AdvertisementThe defence ministry key7670 key7677 declined to confirm those reports, citing an ongoing investigation.
<br>Armed clashes
The operation came key7667 as South Korea on Wednesday restarted tours to the southern part of the DMZ, which has seen several armed clashes but also served as a venue for key inter-Korean events, including some of the most recent summits.
<br>But the programme was suspended in October 2019 key7675 after an outbreak of deadly African swine fever broke out in North Korea, and then due to concerns about the novel coronavirus this year.
<br>Unification Minister Lee In-young, celebrating the tours' resumption, made no mention of the North Korean man but called for free travel among all Koreans within the DMZ and a recovery of inter-Korean hotlines severed amid strained ties.
<br>"Re-establishing round-the-clock communication channels would be a basis for restoring inter-Korean relations," Lee, who oversees key7672 cross-border affairs, told a ceremony at the truce village of Panmunjom within the DMZ.
<br>In 2018, a North Korean soldier defected to South Korea via the eastern DMZ. North Korean troops fired at another soldier when he drove an army truck through the DMZ in a dramatic escape to the South in 2017.
<br>Inter-Korean relations soured as denuclearisation talks between Pyongyang and Washington stalled last year. In September, North Korean troops shot dead a South Korean fisheries official who went missing at sea, sparking public and political furore in the South. - Reuters

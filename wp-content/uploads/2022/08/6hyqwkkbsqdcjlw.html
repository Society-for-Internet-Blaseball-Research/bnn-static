“The world faces numerous challenges, from conflict to climate change, from key12561 key12560 prejudice to growing inequality. We see people turning inwards and we see a crisis of solidarity,” said key12564 the Secretary-General in his address.
<br>“The Buddha’s teachings can inspire us to become global citizens […] the Buddhist world view teaches us to key12570 see ourselves as key12558 a key12568 part of this world and not as its masters.”
<br>Vesak, the Day of the Full Moon, generally in the month of May, key12557 is the most sacred day to millions of Buddhists around the world.
<br>It was on the Day of Vesak two key12565 and a half millennia ago, in the year 623 B.C., that the Buddha was born. It was also on the Day of Vesak that the Buddha attained enlightenment, and it was on this Day that the Buddha in his eightieth year passed away.
<br>In his message, the Secretary-General highlighted Buddhism’s emphasis on non-violence as a powerful call for peace and said that the teachings of the Buddha remain very relevant in the work of the key12569 UN.
<br>“The focus in Buddhism on the inherent dignity of key12567 life finds resonance today in our 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,” he said, urging everyone commit to overcome <a href="https://www.kwfactoryrolex.com/product/kw-rolex-cellini-mens-39mm-m50525-0015-brown-dial-automatic/">kw rolex cellini mens 39mm m50525 0015 brown dial automatic</a> differences, care for the most vulnerable and “truly leave no one behind as we key12566 navigate the path to a better future for all.”
<br>Speaking alongside Mr. Guterres, Miroslav Lajčák, the President of the General Assembly also underscored the importance of the “timeless principles” of Buddhism to the work of the UN.
<br>“They offer insights and ideals on improving the condition key12563 of the planet; they show us the way key12562 to a more sustainable future. They remind us to recognise the key12559 inherent dignity of all people. They shine a light on the path to peace – peace among nations, and peace within people,” he said.
<br>In 1999, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution in which it recognized the Day of Vesak to acknowledge the contribution that Buddhism, one of the oldest key12556 religions in the world, has made for over two and a half millennia and continues to make to the spirituality of humanity.

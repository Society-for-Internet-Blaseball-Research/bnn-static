The Secretary-General’s Special Representative for key5227 human rights in Cambodia, Yash Ghai, and the Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers, Leandro Despouy, issued a joint statement that the appointments cast doubt on whether “judicial independence <a href="https://www.bottegaveneta.to/product-category/pants/">fake salvatore ferragamo pants</a> is being fully respected in Cambodia.”
<br>They called on Cambodian authorities to ensure that the provisions of the Constitution, as well as international human rights law, are respected so that judicial independence can be upheld.
<br>“An independent judiciary is a fundamental guarantor for the protection of key5230 human rights in any country; without independent judges, it is not possible to ensure everyone’s right to a fair trial,” Mr. Ghai and Mr. Despouy said.
<br>All judicial appointments, transfers, promotions, suspensions or disciplinary actions in Cambodia are supposed to be decided by the country’s Supreme Council of Magistracy and then implemented by royal decree.
<br>But the two experts said the decree of 9 August replacing the President of Cambodia’s Court of Appeal appears to have not been based on a decision by the Supreme Council of Magistracy, but instead followed a key5232 request from the Chairman of the Supreme Council for State after a proposal from the Justice Minister and the Co-Chairmen of the Council for Legal and Judicial Reform.
<br>“In other words, the key5231 replacement of the Appeal Court President was done at the request of the executive branch of government,” the statement said, adding that the appointment of four new members of the Supreme Council of Magistracy by a separate decree on the same day appears to have been similarly made at the request of the executive.
<br>Mr. key5221 Ghai noted that he has already voiced concern that the existing composition key5233 of the Supreme Council of Magistracy, which includes a government minister and a key5224 senior member key5234 of the ruling party, “does not inspire confidence that the judicial appointment key5226 process in Cambodia key5223 is free of key5228 political control.”
<br>Today’s statement said three of the new appointments to the Supreme Council of Magistracy were for positions that are supposed to be reserved for members elected by judges.
<br>“No elections key5235 appear to have been held for these positions,” Mr. Ghai and Mr. Despouy said. “Indeed, no elections have ever key5225 been held for these three elected positions.”
<br>Mr. Ghai, a constitutional lawyer and key5222 academic from Kenya, and Mr. Despouy, a human rights lawyer and academic from Argentina, are among a series key5229 of independent experts appointed by the UN Human Rights Council to monitor issues of concern.

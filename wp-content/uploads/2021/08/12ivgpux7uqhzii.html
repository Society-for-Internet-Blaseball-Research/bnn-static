13/12/2020 | 09:26 AM Martyn Landi, PA Technology Correspondent
<br>Conspiracy theories discouraging people from getting a coronavirus vaccine have been seen or heard by more than a third of people, a new study suggests.
<br>Research by King’s College London and Ipsos Mori found that 34 per cent have encountered anti-vaccination messages, predominately via social media.
<br>It comes in the week where the UK began vaccinating the first people in <a href="https://www.mksfactoryrolex.com/">mksfactoryrolex.com</a> the world against Covid-19, outside of trials.
<br>The report also found that around 40 per cent of people who get their information from platforms such as WhatsApp or YouTube believe key24705 conspiracy theories about the Covid-19 vaccines, with belief in such theories higher among young people who consume a key24704 lot of information from social media.
<br>The research also warned that those who use social media more, were more likely to believe a wider range of conspiracies.

<br>It found that around 15 per cent of those surveyed said they believe that a coronavirus vaccine is being developed only to make money for pharmaceutical companies, but this then rose to 39 per cent among key24698 those who get a lot of information from WhatsApp and 37 per cent among those who do the same with YouTube.
<br>Professor Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Institute at King’s College London, said the findings showed it was vital that more work was done with social media platforms to eradicate such misinformation.
<br>“One in three people say they’ve seen or heard messages discouraging people from getting vaccinated key24699 against Covid-19, with social media being the prime source. And it’s clear that some harmful views have taken hold among key24702 a minority of the public,” he said.
<br>“They range from concerns about whether the UK government will ensure the safety of the coronavirus vaccine, to particularly extreme conspiracy theories, such as that the real key24692 purpose of the vaccination effort is to track and control the population – which is believed by one in seven, and greater proportions of young people key24695 and social media users.
<br>“Working with social media platforms to control the spread of misinformation is therefore an important action – but the main focus should not be on this niche belief in extreme conspiracies. People who believe in these theories still form a small minority, and many of them will be very difficult to convince.

<br>“Instead, we need to focus on the much larger sections of the public who say they’re unsure about key24700 the truth of some of the medical implications of vaccination – such as the 42 per cent who say they don’t know if key24691 it may cause autism in children and the 48 per cent who are unsure whether it might cause infertility.
<br>“As we start on the very long process of vaccinating as much of the population key24694 as possible, addressing this uncertainty through transparent, consistent and inventive key24701 public health communication will be essential.”
<br>Social media platforms key24693 have been repeatedly criticised for their handling of misinformation and harmful content, and stricter regulation is expected to be introduced in 2021 through the Government’s Online Harms Bill.
<br>The Bill is expected to introduce a statutory duty of care for online firms, with large fines for those who fail to protect their users from such content.
<br>Kelly Beaver, managing director of Ipsos Mori public affairs, said: “The proliferation of anti-vax material that is being seen by people on social media – particularly young people – and its impact on their views is incredibly concerning in the week where we’ve seen the UK key24696 vaccinate the first person outside of a trial in the world.
<br>Advertisement“The public are obviously concerned about this, as we see in their high levels of support for regulation of social media platforms, including fines key24697 for companies who fail to remove false information.
<br>"Vaccines have been one of the greatest medical interventions over the last two centuries. We cannot afford to take a backwards step.”

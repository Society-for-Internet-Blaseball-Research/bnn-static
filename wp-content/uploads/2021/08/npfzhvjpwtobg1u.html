Reguilon has helped Tottenham keep four successive clean sheets in the Premier League	
AdvertisementHowever, Real Madrid inserted a £41m (&euro;45m) buyback clause into the deal taking him to north London.
<br>And Bernabeu Digital, via El Chiringuito, key28729 claim Real chiefs are preparing to activate the clause to bring Reguilon back to key28737 Madrid.
<br>Before signing for Tottenham, Reguilon spent the 2019/20 season on loan at Sevilla as he was behind key28734 Ferland Mendy and Marcelo in the Los Blancos pecking order.
<br>AdvertisementThe report adds Marcelo’s performances this season ‘have not convinced’ Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane or the club’s fans.
<br>The Brazilian turns 33 next year and key28731 could leave to make space for Reguilon’s return.
<br>Adrian Durham says Jack Grealish's £100million price tag is justified and that Spurs should key28732 key28727 sign Englishman in January to complete 'lethal' front three

<br>British key3892 and Canadian authorities have given seven soldiers killed more than a century key3891 ago in the First World War a full military burial after their remains were key3895 discovered during a gas pipeline construction near Ypres, Belgium.
<br>The soldiers were found in key3889 two separate burial sites near the Belgian town at the heart of Flanders Fields, key3898 where hundreds of thousands perished between 1914 to 1918.
<br>The ceremony took place on Thursday at the New Irish Farm Commonwealth War Grave near Ypres.

<br>In <a href="https://www.e-juice.ca/product-category/devices/non-nicotine-vape/">0mg nicotine vape juice</a> total, 63 sets of First World War soldiers’ remains were uncovered by archaeologists during the work between 2014 and 2016.
<br>“We remember, we reconnect with Private John Lambert. He was a mechanic making 40 cents a day… signed up to make one dollar a key3894 day and immediately gave 60 cents a day to his sister,” said Reverend Gary Watt, referring to one of key3897 the soldiers, Canadian Private John Lambert of the Newfoundland Regiment.
<br>AdvertisementMr Lambert was identified through DNA. He died on August 16 1917.
<br>“He exaggerated his key3899 age in order to answer more willingly and more readily the call to serve freedom and democracy,” Mr Watt continued. “Private John Lambert had common sense of the common good. He knew key3893 that complacency would not stop the robbing of freedom.”

<br>Five of the remains were from key3890 unknown British soldiers, and one key3886 unknown German key3887 soldier was also reburied. Archaeologists have discovered artefacts that link the unknown soldiers to Britain and Germany.
<br>The evolution of DNA technology has allowed for the identification of more and more unknown soldiers from the First World War.
<br>Earlier key3888 this month, a great-great-nephew of English poet William Wordsworth – who was recently identified by DNA research – was given a funeral ceremony in France, 105 years after he died.

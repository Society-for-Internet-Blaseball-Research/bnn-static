Nottingham Forest manager Billy Davies hopes captain Andy Reid can lead his side to the Premier League, after news the midfielder has signed a new two-year contract with the club.
<br>The former Tottenham man, who started his career at Forest before moving to White Hart Lane, was instrumental in the Tricky Trees’ emphatic victory over West Ham in their FA Cup third round tie, netting in the 90th minute to seal a 5-0 hammering at the City Ground.
<br>Forest have enjoyed a positive opening-half of the key1987 Championship season, with their recent turn of form – losing just once in their last ten games – seeing key1994 them sit in fifth place.
<br>AdvertisementWith promotion firmly in their sights, Davies is hoping the 31-year-old Republic of Ireland international can give his side the impetus needed to end key1988 the key1990 club’s 13-year absence from the top flight.
<br>“I’m delighted to announce Andy Reid has just signed a new two-year contract,” the Forest boss confirmed.
<br>“He is working really hard in training, he key1992 looks in a very good condition, which is very important, and we key1981 all know he’s got the quality.
<br>Advertisement“We’ve key1983 made him captain and what we’d like now is for him to lead this team to the Premier key1989 League, that’s the most important objective and we’re delighted to have him here for another two years.”

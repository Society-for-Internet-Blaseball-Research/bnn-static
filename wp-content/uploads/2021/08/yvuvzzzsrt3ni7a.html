Amazon’s advertising business grew roughly 44% in the first quarter. Click to enlarge.
<br>Amazon still keeps its ad business in an “Other” line item in its earning statements. Advertising comprises the bulk of that account, but we can’t precisely speak about ad revenue key11390 and growth because there are other things in that line item.
<br>On the earnings call Thursday, Amazon CFO Dave Fildes did say the company had a strong quarter in terms of ad revenue and that the revenue growth rate of advertising held steady from the prior quarter.

<br>Amazon did, of course, see some impact from COVID-19 in March with “some pullback from advertisers and downward pressure on price.” He added, “It wasn’t as noticeable as maybe with what some others are seeing, and it’s probably offset key11393 a bit by the continued strong traffic we have to the site.”
<br>Going into April, “now advertisers continue to advertise at a high clip,” said Fildes, though ad prices continue to be lower.

<br>With massive shifts in consumer demand, shipping delays and fulfillment challenges, the past month and key11395 a half has been a roller coaster for Amazon sellers. Amazon advertisers who have continued to have inventory available and keep campaigns running have largely been able to enjoy low CPCs and high impressions during this key11389 time. key11400 But not without the volatility that has underscored this crisis.
<br>“The biggest lesson from Q1 and the early weeks of Q2 is key11396 that conditions can and do change rapidly, as evidenced by the rapid rise of sales attributed key11386 to Sponsored Products in <a href="https://www.xffactoryrolex.com/product/xf-rolex-day-date-rolex-calibre-2836-2813-mens-m228235-0025-rose-gold-tone/">xf rolex day date rolex calibre 2836 2813 mens m228235 0025 rose gold tone</a> mid-April key11392 shortly after stimulus deposits,” said Andy Taylor, Tinuiti’s director of research in the agencies’ first-quarter Amazon Ads Benchmark report.

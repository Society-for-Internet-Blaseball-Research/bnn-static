You wouldn’t necessarily associate Roy Keane with the word love but then again Valentine’s Day is known as key17432 a day of surprises.
<br>And on Instagram, the former midfielder sent a message to all the lovers out there in a post that had its own unique spin on it.
<br>1
Keane has made a blistering start to his social media ‘career’	
AdvertisementThe Manchester United legend excited fans everywhere when it was revealed he’d joined the social networking site.
<br>His first post appeared on Friday, uploading a key17431 selfie with his dog, which was captioned: “A man’s best friend.”
<br>And the signs suggest he’ll be very active on Instagram with his second post coming just two days later.
<br>AdvertisementDespite objecting to the way players hug each other key17437 before and after matches, Keane urged his fans to show some love on Valentine’s Day.
<br>However, the message was posted with a picture that you’d totally expect from Keane’s Instagram despite his status as a social media novice.
<br>It’s from his days at Nottingham Forest where he’s being confronted by West Ham players Stuart Slater and Ian Bishop.
<br>In the image is certainly something you shouldn’t do on Valentine’s day with Bishop throttling Keane. Below you can see the post with Keane’s hilarious caption.

<br>Keane’s decision to enter the social media world will have surprised <a href="https://www.vapewebsites.com/product-category/starter-kits/disposable-vape/happ-600-puff/">HAPP Mini Engångs E-cigaretter</a> many but maybe he was influenced by Micah Richards, who he’s struck up a bromance with when working as a pundit for Sky Sports.
<br>The former Manchester City star was in stitches last week as he showed Keane a funny TikTok dance video of himself celebrating as a Man United player on FIFA Ultimate Team.

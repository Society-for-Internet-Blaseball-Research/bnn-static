										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Blaseballers across this material plane are waking up and getting ready for Season 23 of Internet League Blaseball after a much-needed Siesta. If you have been away from Blaseball for a while or just need a refresher, then BNN Sunday is the program for you.</p>



<p>This week, meet BNN Board members <a href="http://twitter.com/catstlats">Cat</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/leto">Dan</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/emfring">Em</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/thesplortshub">Joey</a> as they discuss Blaseball News Network <a href="http://patreon.com/blaseballnews">happenings</a> and recap Season 22. What do the new Suns do? What have collective action and a lot of Pickled Herring revealed in The Library? What does the Coin mean by &#8220;Rising Stars?&#8221; They even explain the newest addition to the BNN Power Rankings: The Hubris Metric. Learn what all of this means (and maybe find BNN) with this Season&#8217;s BNN Sunday. </p>

<p>Those extra stars that come from the Attractor mod? They&#8217;re the fear factor built into the sim&#8217;s data.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s the theory you&#8217;ll find in the sixth episode of BNN&#8217;s Midseason Power Ranking Review. Host <a href="https://twitter.com/haskins_luckey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luckey Haskins</a>, welcomes guests <a href="http://twitter.com/notacredit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jade</a>, Evie, and Erin to discuss the pertinent topics of Season 18 (and thanks to Joey T Badger for producing this episode!).</p>



<p>We start with the ridiculous season the Pies are having to this point. It seems that the BNN contributors had properly estimated the power emanating from Philly this season, as they threaten historical Win records. But BNN had a little more trouble estimating the Mechanics &amp; Lovers, two teams that were ranked in the middle but rocketed in very opposite directions this season.</p>



<p>On the Low side of the Mild league, we&#8217;ve got a few weighty questions about eDensity, that statistic draws the attention of Consumers. The Mild Low teams are in a giant cluster, fighting for Playoff Births, and half the division started sporting red dots early in the Midseason? What gives, and how will this affect the back half of the season?</p>



<p>Not to be out done, the Wild Low gets its turn in the panel&#8217;s spotlight, and oh do they have thoughts. The absolute cluster of teams, their dominance of Wild High teams that aren&#8217;t chthonic felines, and the biggest topic of the day: Chorby Short. Hubris comes early as Evie gives her theories on the extra stars in Chorby&#8217;s profile &#8212; they represent the fear her opponents experience.</p>



<p>The panel touches on what the future holds for rebuilding teams like Canada, Seattle, Chicago (and almost all the Wild High) before we jump into the weekly hubris segment, where all involved pitch their prognostications for the Internet Series finals. The panel turns out to have a lot of estimation for the final two teams left standing, so grab a Shadow Fax and put the video below into your brain&#8217;s receptacle!</p>

<p>Season 17 comes out with a menu, and presents it to you. There are two options: Steak, or Pie?</p>



<p>In the fifth episode of BNN&#8217;s Midseason Power Ranking Review, we join anchor <a href="https://twitter.com/Leto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dan</a> and host <a href="https://twitter.com/haskins_luckey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luckey Haskins</a>, alongside their guests: broadcaster for the LA Unlimited Tacos <a href="http://twitter.com/BenjaminRees" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Benjamin Rees</a>, and Sunbeams reporter <a href="http://twitter.com/PandaSunbeams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Panda</a>!</p>



<p>The panel looks at the teams that are pacing the league, which all happen to be in the Mild League. Of those, the Steaks and Pies have been trading the league lead back and forth. Who do you have to finish up top?</p>



<p>Right below the Steaks &amp; Pies are the Magic &amp; the Tacos, two teams that have the shortest rosters in the entire ILB. The panel looks at the ups and downs of what it means when you have a consistent but high-risk roster. </p>



<p>Taking a tour around the rest of the league, can the Worms make a second playoff run and maybe even contend for the championship? Will Mind Tricks vault Houston to the top? Does anyone actually want to win the Wild High division?</p>



<p>Finally, a Community Chest lands, and the panel talks about the Items inside. What else was inside? HUBRIS, naturally. Everyone discusses the finals they think will come to pass, sometimes picking theme over probability. What themes? Well, you&#8217;ll have to watch the latest episode to find out!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s fitting: in a season that has been delayed by not one, but TWO Spillover events, the MPRR is also delayed (hooray, vaccination!).</p>



<p>In the fourth episode of BNN&#8217;s Midseason Power Ranking Review, we join anchor <a href="https://twitter.com/Leto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dan</a> and host <a href="https://twitter.com/haskins_luckey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luckey Haskins</a>, alongside guests and Power Ranking contributors and team reporters: <a href="http://twitter.com/notacredit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jade</a> (Lovers) and Panda (Sunbeams | ThePanda1016#7314 on Discord)!</p>



<p>The Chicago Firefighters are this season&#8217;s owners of the &#8220;Where is BNN?&#8221; mantle, so the group talks about the team&#8217;s offseason moves, hot start, and playoff hopes for Season 16. Discussion also weaves in the Firefighters (and Wild High) in relation to the Wild Low, which has three hot teams gunning for the Playoffs: the stalwart Tacos, the newcomer Worms, and the Spies, who just got off their Middling ride up the standings.</p>



<p>As the panel shifts over to the Mild League, the Power Rankings have been spot-on with the dominance of the Dallas Steaks. Meanwhile, the Mild Low is a fascinating jumble of teams vying for the top spot and the remaining Mild Playoff spots. Can they keep pace with the surging Mild High teams like the Pies and Mechanics (another expansion team in the hunt!)?</p>



<p>After covering the league, the group looks at strategy &#8212; spend coins on Ballpark Renovations, or save them for the Blessing raffle? What are teams in rebuilding mode doing to get back to the Playoffs? How much influence can coordination really exert, as the game grows and fans act as their own accordance?</p>



<p>Finally we arrive at the weekly hubris segment, where all involved pitch their prognostications for the Internet Series finals. Hubris is launched into the immateria like a player caught in a Salmon Cannon, but will any prediction return from Elsewhere to turn out correct? Check out the latest episode to find out!</p>

<p>New weather, who dis?</p>



<p>In this third installment of BNN&#8217;s Midseason Power Ranking Review, we join anchor <a href="https://twitter.com/Leto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dan</a>, host <a href="https://twitter.com/haskins_luckey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luckey Haskins</a>, recurring guest <a href="https://twitter.com/ilianaquorum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iliana</a> of SIBR, and <a href="https://twitter.com/Rfoluler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rhett Foluler</a>, BNN beat reporter covering the New York Millennials.</p>



<p>The panel looks at the hot starts of the Millennials (consistent with the <a href="/2021/04/04/blaseball-power-rankings-season-15/">Season 15 Power Rankings</a>) and the Miami Dale (a surprise, based on those Rankings). The big question in both cases: are these division leads sustainable, or are they mirages based on schedule and luck of the draw?</p>



<p>Discussion quickly delves (or devolves) into discussion of the new Salmon weather and the density of Chorby Soul&#8217;s soul, and the effect these have on the game of Blaseball. Wild speculation, like a wild-caught <em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>, is rampant. Hopefully the panel did not lose any runs as you watch this video on repeat.

<p>The Yellowstone Magic had one question:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="360" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwuCkPPWEAAcm-8.jpeg?resize=640%2C360&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-1374" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwuCkPPWEAAcm-8.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwuCkPPWEAAcm-8.jpeg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwuCkPPWEAAcm-8.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwuCkPPWEAAcm-8.jpeg?w=1043&amp;ssl=1 1043w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>BNN is here with the second Midseason Power Ranking Review, with anchor <a href="https://twitter.com/Leto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dan</a>, host <a href="https://twitter.com/haskins_luckey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luckey Haskins</a>, and guests <a href="https://twitter.com/ilianaquorum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iliana</a> of SIBR and <a href="https://twitter.com/draywo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Draywo</a>, BNN contributor &amp; a captain for the expansion Ohio Worms.</p>



<p>Our panelists dig into the hot first half for the Magic (which Dan totally called), the sustainability of the Lovers&#8217; and Moist Talkers success, and marvel at the delightful randomness that is a Blaseball team&#8217;s schedule. They deconstruct the struggles of the reigning champs in Baltimore, also wondering what&#8217;s behind the underperformance of other teams with high hopes like Chicago and New York.</p>



<p>On the Wild side, the group marvels at the star power on the mound in both the High and Low divisions. They dig into the pitching stlats and the powerful mystery of &#8220;defense&#8221; that seems to be key in the Expansion Era. With Draywo on the show, everyone takes stock of the strong starts from the Lift and the Worms, two teams that spent last season in power dives towards Party Time.</p>



<p>Finally, they break a few hubris meters by makings predictions of Internet Series finals matchups. Find out who buried the hubris needle by watching this episode of BNN Midseason Power Ranking Review!</p>

<p>In the first episode of BNN&#8217;s newest show, the Midseason Power Ranking Review, host <a href="https://twitter.com/Leto">Dan</a> is joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/haskins_luckey">Luckey Haskins</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/FirewallAndrews">Firewall Andrews</a> and special guest <a href="https://twitter.com/ilianaquorum">iliana</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/SIBROfficial">SIBR</a> to discuss the state of play in Season 13 and what went right &#8212; and wrong &#8212; in our <a href="/2021/03/07/blaseball-power-rankings-for-season-13/">Season 13 power rankings</a>. </p>



<p>The crew discuss the origins of the power rankings and talk a bit about their approach, then dive into the main topic &#8230;</p>



<p>Are the Tacos really <em>that</em> good? Both Firewall and iliana ranked them first overall in the preseason and discuss why they were so high on the Taco Baco. </p>



<p>Then, focus shifts to the Mild Subleague, where the Crabs and Moist Talkers are battling for control of the Mild Low. Can the Talkers keep rolling off of their Earlseason blessing? Or will all become Crab once again? What makes the Crabs so good, and what flaws might Canada have heading into the postseason?</p>



<p>The panel also discusses the Mild High, and considers the playoff hopes of the Steaks and Millennials, then asks if anyone can catch the Firefighters in the Wild High thanks to their Lateseason buff. </p>



<p>Finally, they discuss the expansion teams and the Tokyo Lift, and consider where each team needs to improve to make a splash in ILB in seasons to come.</p>



<p>You can watch the video below, or check it out live each week on Wednesday at 8 PM EST, 5 PM PST, or whatever else it might be in your time zone, live on <a href="https://glimesh.tv/dan">Dan&#8217;s Glimesh channel</a>. </p>

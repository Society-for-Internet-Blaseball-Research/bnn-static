					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Hex struggled at first in LA, but found their groove in Season 10 as a consistent lead-off hitter who could get on base regularly (although, like most Tacos, they are an absolute nincompoop on the basepaths). This began a run of very good production, with 5 consecutive seasons of an OPS+ above 100, with the offensive-heavy environs of Season 11 Wild Low providing the best year of Hex&#8217;s career. That season, they made the most of Divisional Walk In The Park lead the League in walks with 98, good for just under one a game and 16 higher than second place, as well as an OPS+ of 135 &#8211; a brilliant season that earned Hex a place in the All-Time Tacos.

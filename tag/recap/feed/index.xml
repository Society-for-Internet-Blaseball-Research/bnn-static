<h2 class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #fa8a10; font-family: Lora;"><b>The Final Countdown</b></span></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #fa8a10; font-family: Lora;"><b>Levil Teams Claim Victory!</b></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora;">MAFIA IS MAYHEM!</span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><strong>QUICK HITS FROM THE IMMATERIAL PLANE</strong></span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>Shock and Claw</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Baltimore Crabs were the next victim of the Levil Teams. The Crabs had successfully utilized their Electric Blood to zap away the Votes of Levil Teams several days in a row. With the numbers of Teams dwindling they had become a thorn in the side of Levil that could no longer be ignored, so it was time for the Crabs to Ascend. Or just Incinerated. Crabs Glood? Crabs Levil? Crabs Dead.
</span></span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>Eye Spy a Sus Team</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;">As desperation kicked in the League became deeply Divided. The Chicago Firefighters and Yellowstone Magic proposed the Houston Spies as Levil, whilst the Moist Talkers and Spies argued they should Revoke the Seattle Garages. Rampant Speculation took place over the Day, would the Baltimore Crabs have been able to zap away a Vote before they were Incinerated? As Sun (X) sank below the Horizon the question was answered. The Houston Spies had 3 Votes, and the Seattle Garages had 2. Naturally, the Breckenridge Jazz Hands had lodged their single Vote for the Canada Moist Talkers. When the Votes were Counted, the result was a Tie between the Spies and Garages. The Garages superior Divine Favor saved the Day for a second time, and the Spies were Revoked revealing a… Glood Team!?</span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>The Magic Goes Away</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Weather a miracle has occurred! The unending streak of Solar Eclipses has been bro- oh. Sorry. The Weather Radar had Tuned into some other Season. The Yellowstone Magic were the final Team to be Incinerated during the Night. Despite their name implying otherwise the Magic had no special Role, much to the chagrin of their Champions. In the end they weren’t Incinerated for potentially holding a Role, nor even for being a leadership figure to the Glood Teams. They were Incinerated because they were a Normal Team doing Glood Things, and since the last Levil Team needed the Moist Talkers and Jazz Hands to be alive they were left to choose between the Chicago Firefighters and the Yellowstone Magic. Ultimately they chose to rob the League of its Magic.</span></span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>Foreclosure</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;">The Sun (X) rose and the Final Day began. The Breckenridge Jazz Hands stood up, and openly called out to the Seattle Garages to support them, to which the Garages responded with a powerful declaration of “Revoke Canada Moist Talkers”. The Moist Talkers and Chicago Firefighters fired back and Voted to Revoke the Seattle Garages, tying things up. With no further action to take until the Day ended, the Teams chose to spend the rest of it having fun and reminiscing over the past several weeks of Mafia. In the end the Game came down to Fate, and was decided by Divine Favor. The Canada Moist Talkers had an extremely Glood Divine Favor of 5, but the Seattle Garages had a Divine Favor of 3, meaning the Vote ended with the Moist Talkers Revoked. Now Revealed as Baristas the Jazz Hands<strong> [REDACTED]</strong> the Observed Moist Talkers and escaped into the Secret Base securing their Win.</span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>Chained Together</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;">The Seattle Garages and the Chicago Firefighters were the last two teams left, so, Game Over. Well, not quite. The Seattle Garages were still too close to the Firefighters when they were Incinerated. So for the first time the Instability Chained&#8230;right back to the Garages, who were promptly Incinerated by a Rogue Ump, and their Debt Collected. Now left alone in the League the Hellmouth Sunbeams exited Party Time and made a clean sweep of the Season 200X Internet Series. Don’t worry, there’s no need to fear about the Fate of Internet League Blaseball. The ever helpful Monitor has granted Teams permission to play in the Trench, marking the end of Mafia, and the Creation of the first ever Season of Trench League Blaseball.</span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>CONGRATULATIONS!</b></span></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #fa8a10; font-family: Lora;"><b>TEAMS CLOWN AROUND</b></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora;">MAFIA IS MAYHEM!</span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;">QUICK HITS FROM THE IMMATERIAL PLANE</span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>A DISCLAIMER</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

To the best of your knowledge, information and belief this article will not make its way into the hands of an Active Mafia Champion.</span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>TACO BA-GONE</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Week started with the League down to 13 Teams, with 4 Debts remaining among us. The Debted Teams couldn’t afford to let the Hardboiled LA Unlimited Tacos live any longer and so they Paid the Ultimate Price during Night 6. The Tacos dramatic reveal at the end of Day 5 had saved the Chicago Firefighters, and then chained into Revoking the Levil Atlantis Georgias and San Francisco Lovers one after the other. Without their leadership and guidance will the Glood Teams fall apart?</span></span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>Gotta Had it to them</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;">The Breckenridge Jazz Hands added their name to the list of Teams making Claims. In order to undercut suspicions aimed at them, the Jazz Hands announced that they were the second Neultral Team, and that their Win condition was to Revoke the Canada Moist Talkers. The Moist Talkers, who famously do not know what their Role does, felt the Claim fit with what they knew about their Role and chose to believe the Jazz Hands. A Bargain was struck between the League and the Jazz Hands. If possible the League will ask the Moist Talkers for Forgiveness and then Revoke them. In Return the Jazz Hands will assist in eliminating the Levil Teams. Naturally, the Jazz Hands will just as easily betray the League if it will help them achieve their goal. &nbsp;</span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>Thanks it has Pockets</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Revoking two Levil Teams, the Miami Dale looked to extend the streak to a third and complete a Hat Trick. The Baltimore Crabs and Canada Moist Talkers stood by their side to try and eliminate the Tokyo Lift. The Lift had been using Elsewhere to befriend and scramble the Chicago Firefighters. When the Lift became the top choice for Revoking the Firefighters were resistant to the idea, and instead looked to Revoke the Breckenridge Jazz Hands. Thanks to the Baltimore Crabs’ Vote Suppression the Vote was tied between the two, setting the Day for an electrifying finish. The Dale convinced the Yellowstone Magic to Change sides, and they broke the tie. To the absolute devastation of the Chicago Firefighters the Lift admitted their guilt, telling the Firefighters they had been using them as fall guys. With a clear confession the League easily Revoked the Tokyo Lift, and their Debt was Relieved.</span></span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>Zapped Away</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;">In Weather, the streak of Solar Eclipses has continued unimpeded, along with the unbroken chain of Team Incinerations at the hands of Rogue Umpires. Words were no longer enough to Deal with the Miami Dale, the most Valuable Players in the Game, so the Debted Teams had them Incinerated. The Dale had caused quite the ruckus, and were in the process of Consolidating the Glood Teams together and giving the League a Guaranteed Win. They say you can’t leave anything behind when you die, but the Dale left behind ‘The Chart’ listing the Teams they believed to be the Debt Holders, now the only thing left to do is see if their prediction will come to pass. </span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>Down and Out</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;">A Night Shift had impacted the Core Mechanics, swapping out one Champion for another. The two Champions held drastically different playstyles, and the new erratic style caused suspicion to land on the Mechs. Further examination of the Mechs Voting patterns made the situation worse. The Mechanics were also one of the Teams listed on the Dale’s Chart to Revoke, the combination of factors sent them to the top of the list of suspects. The League couldn’t resist another nail biting finish, and ultimately the Core Mechanics joined the Atlantis Georgias, San Francisco Lovers, and Tokyo Lift in admitting their guilt and allowed themselves to be Revoked gracefully.</span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>The Death Mints</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;">The Breath Mints were the first proper Role Claim, and they even backed it up with proof! The Kansas City Breath Mints Claimed at the beginning of Day 2 that they had a power that meant their Votes counted for double, and then showed it off by Voting for themselves. They had courted Incineration Day after Day, but every Night the Levil Teams always felt that there was someone just a bit more threatening. But with the total number of Teams dropping into single digits it was time for the Breath Mints to go, and the Levil Teams provided them a swift entry into the Town Hall.</span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>Tie Died</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;">Day Nine dawned over the League, signalling the start of yet another chaotic day. With only two Debts remaining the Levil Teams chances of victory were shrinking rapidly. The Ohio Worms made a large move, Claiming a Role often called a ‘Medium’ &#8211; that is, they Claimed that they could talk to Deceased Glood Teams. Despite a small chance of success it seemed that some of the last Teams were willing to believe the spurious Claims, and the Day was spent with Teams suspicions divided between the Houston Spies, Ohio Worms, and Seattle Garages. When the Yellowstone Magic saw three Votes for the Worms and three for the Garages they gave up on pushing the Spies and swapped their Vote to the Ohio Worms to try and avoid a tie, forgetting about the Crabs ability to Suppress a Vote. When reached for comment the Crabs Champions had this to say “oh god what no”. The Day Closed with the actual Votes for the Worms and Garages tied at 3. Fans went wild speculating about the process for breaking ties. Mafia operates on Blaseball Rules, and that means ties are broken via Divine Favor. The Garages had a Divine Favor of 3 and the Worms’ was 12. The Worms couldn’t worm their way out of this one and were Revoked. The Reveal confirmed Fan Theories as the Ohio Worms Debt was Relieved and their Negative Mod was displayed for all to see, which had allowed them to appear as Glood when Investigated.</span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>Gods&#8217; Night</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;">Now it is Gods’ Night, the very last Gods’ Night. Seven Teams Remain, and there is only one Debt among us. Can the last Levil Team Claim victory from the jaws of defeat, or will the Glood Teams Close it out? Will the Breckenridge Jazz Hands succeed in Revoking the Canada Moist Talkers?

<h2>SEASON 10 IS FINISHED.</h2>



<h2>(So is the discipline era).</h2>



<p>Hey there everybody, Benson &#8220;Nutty&#8221; Newton here with the traditional full Season recap! I hope you&#8217;re ready to buckle in and read about some of the most exciting happenings of our beloved Season 10. Ascension was finally achieved and there seems to be a new Boss in town. Oh, yeah, we also killed a god.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>At the end of Blaseball Season 9 &#8211; Discipline Era: Forecast, three Decrees were passed by the Blaseball community: Forecast: Birds, Forecast: Blooddrain, and Forecast: Solar Eclipse. </p>



<p>These three weather types had established and known effects upon our beloved Players. Birds often did nothing, except for occasionally chewing a Shelled player out of their Shell (more on that later). The Blooddrain, when it gurgled, allowed a Player to siphon ability from one of their opponents. The Solar Eclipses&#8230; well&#8230; During those, Rogue Umpires would often Incinerate players, sending them straight to the Hall of Flame as a replacement was called up. </p>



<p>These Decrees, in addition to setting the weather for Season 10 to only these three, modified Players on every team.</p>



<ul><li>Forecast: Birds gave a Pitcher on each Team &#8220;Friend of Crows,&#8221; allowing them to encourage birds to attack a Batter during Birds weather, causing an Out.</li><li>Forecast: Blooddrain made a Player on every Team a Siphoner, making them siphon blood more often during Blooddrain weather. Also, Siphoning could remove a ball from a pitch count or add a defensive Out.</li><li>Forecast: Solar Eclipse gave a Batter on each team Fire Eater, causing them to swallow fire instead of being Incinerated during a Solar Eclipse. When a Player swallowed fire, the became Magmatic and hit a home run in their next at bat. </li></ul>



<p>These new and special effects hurt and hindered Players and Teams throughout the League, but the main attraction was the pure amount of Blooddraining all those Siphoners caused. </p>



<p><strong>There were 84 Siphons in 99 Days. The next closest in a Season has been 29, in Season 7.</strong></p>



<p>A major benefitiary of all of  this Blooddraining was Richardson Graves of the Charleston Shoe Thieves, who became the best Defensive player in recorded ILB history, in addition to being the first Seven Star player in any statistical area. </p>

<p>Somehow, with all of the Solar Eclipses, only two Players were Incinerated. However, these fan favorite Players are sure to be missed.</p>



<h3>RIV YEONG-HO BENITEZ OF THE PHILLY PIES.</h3>



<h3>RIV ANNIE ROLAND OF THE YELLOWSTONE MAGIC.</h3>



<p>Welcome to the League, Yusef Puddles and Bonk Jokes!</p>

<h1 class="has-text-align-center">TIME FOR CRAB.</h1>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">BALTIMORE CRABS gain their third championship and ascend.</h2>
</div></div>



<p>Following a Regular Season that was filled with relatively few surprises (at least to me!) we entered a Postseason that started off with a bang. The Wild Card Round was drawn up, pulling the Hellmouth Sunbeams and New York Millennials out of #PartyTime to face off against the 4th Place teams from both Leagues, the Unlimited Tacos and Philly Pies.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EkeduuSWkAcDmXy?format=png&amp;name=900x900" alt="Image"/></figure></div>



<p>Well:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eke-sfpUYAEuD_y?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="Image"/></figure></div>



<p>The Millenials &amp; Sunbeams quickly completed 2-0 defeats of their opponents and we moved on with the rest of the playoffs. Skipping to the Finals, the Playoffs worked out like this:</p>

<p>The Baltimore Crabs quickly sent the Shoe Thieves packing with a 3-0 defeat, preventing another big comeback from the very same team that was their opponent the year before.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cover alignfull has-background-dim" style="background-image:url(https://blaseballnewsnetwork.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/ezgif-3-c939f94909c2.png)"><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
<h1 class="has-text-align-center">THE SHELLED ONE RETURNS.</h1>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">battle ENSUES. AGAIN.</h2>
</div></div>



<p>The Crabs, with a fresh League Championship under their belt, then got the honor to face off against the Terrifying and Horrible Shelled One&#8217;s Pods, a team formed by the Big Peanut that&#8217;s been lurking around for the majority of the Discipline era, almost entirely out of players that happened to be Shelled at the conclusion of Season 9.</p>



<p>I would write something about the grand battle between The Shelled One and the Most Powerful Dynasty That Blaseball Has Ever Seen (Crabs) here or give you an image to look at, but I simply don&#8217;t have much more information than this:</p>



<p>The Shelled One&#8217;s hit a single Single, completely and instantly demolishing the Team Spirit of the Crabs, defeating them in one Pitch.</p>

<h1 class="has-text-align-center"><strong>THE HALL STARS ARRIVE.</strong></h1>
</div></div>



<p><strong>&#8220;Landry Violence Rises.&#8221;</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EkkmIGvXIAAkLQq?format=png&amp;name=900x900" alt="Image"/></figure></div>



<p>Oh, what a beautiful thing to see, what a beautiful thing to read. The Monitor appeared to fight the Shelled One, bringing with it all of our past Incinerated friends, fourteen of them in fact, like it had promised us so long ago that it would. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EkkmS60WMAAtw4z?format=png&amp;name=900x900" alt="Image"/></figure></div>



<p>With a monstrous Team Spirit Bar that dwarfed even the Shelled One&#8217;s (the Hall Star&#8217;s Spirit was roughly equal to the total tribute to the 14 players), the two teams went to battle. </p>



<p>The teams went back and forth, exchanging inning after inning of hits, ours, strikes, balls, and home runs. Sebastian Telephone, a member of the Hall Stars, was tragically Incinerated once again, a mere few innings back into his second lease on life (RIV). Axel Trololol  and Jaylen Hotdogfingers (who was sent back to the Hall of Flame in Idol Board high jinks we don&#8217;t have the time to cover today [Spoiler: Tillman Henderson was brought back from the dead. Largely accidentally]) swapped between the teams continually (Though both were Saboteurs who sometimes purposefully failed while on the Shelled Ones). Other intense happenings, well, happened. </p>



<p>It was a game of Blaseball but yet, so much more.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EkkqxtIW0AI5Upw?format=png&amp;name=small" alt="Image"/></figure>



<p>As the Monitor loomed behind an increasingly irate Shelled One, Landry Violence became Magmatic (Thanks to their Fire Eater perk gained through aforementioned Idol Board happenings) and slammed a home run, putting the Shelled Ones on the ropes.</p>



<p>With a final Homer from the iconic fan-favorite and former New York Millennial, Dominic Marijuana, the Shelled One&#8217;s Pods were defeated. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ekksg13XEAE41xC?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Image"/></figure></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EkksotJX0AE2RM3?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Image"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EkkswZcWAAAVWja?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Image"/></figure>



<p>The moral of the story is that victory is sweet, but Peanuts are bland.</p>



<p>Also, we beat a god.</p>



<p>We Are All Love Blaseball.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cover alignfull has-background-dim" style="background-image:url(https://blaseballnewsnetwork.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/bnn-logo-3.png)"><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
<h1 class="has-text-align-center">THAT&#8217;S ALL FOLKS.</h1>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">THAT&#8217;S THE END OF THE RECAP. THAT&#8217;S IT.</h2>
</div></div>



<p>There&#8217;s much, much more to discuss about the Election and preceding events, such as the Ascension of the Crabs, and a new Team added to the ILB. And&#8230; well&#8230;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ekok5EoWAAcCvyF?format=png&amp;name=900x900" alt="Image"/></figure>



<p>Keep an eye out for that tomorrow.</p>

<p>Season 2 of the Coronation Era is officially notarized and in the books, and before we embark on siesta, let&#8217;s take a look back at the most outstanding players, or MVP, to hit the diamond over the past 90-plus games.</p>



<p>Many thanks to Dargo4#2798 on Discord for organizing the vote, which you can join as a writer on the <a href="https://discord.gg/zNgbw9M4GP">BNN Discord</a>! </p>

<h2>Baldwin Jones Memorial Best Batter Award</h2>



<p>Magic Goo?</p>



<p>Yellowstone swept most of the first-place votes for the newly named Baldwin Jones Best Batter award, with Kiki Avci claiming plenty of votes, but <strong>Demet Cabrera</strong> coming out on top with the most-first place votes and overall ballot points to earn the title of batting MVP for Season 2.</p>



<p>Cabrera finished fourth in the league during the regular season with a 1.320 OPS, and among the 48 players with an OPS of 1.000, they had the second-best defensive rating (Outs Above Average) of 24.4.</p>



<p>They slugged an impressive 42 home runs, most in ILB, chipping in 55 doubles and striking out only 40 times.</p>



<p>Defensively, they ranked 17th overall in OAA, holding down the infield for the Magic from First Base and recording an out on almost 80% of the balls hit in their direction.</p>



<p>Their teammate, Avci, does not play quite as good defense back near the wall in center field, but is maybe even better with the bat, leading the league in OPS at 1.432 and hitting 40 triples and 25 homers in Season 2.</p>



<p>Flowers slugger Zack Sanders finished third in the MVP batter voting, one of only two players with over 100 RBIs on the season and third in the league in doubles.</p>



<p>It was Sheri Friday who led the league in doubles, and they come in fourth on our list, with an impressive .393 batting average and 72 doubles.</p>



<p>A full list of results is available at the bottom of the article.</p>



<h2>Anastasia Isarobot Memorial Best Pitcher Award</h2>



<p>The decision for best pitcher came down to the voters choosing between a pair of aces for The Kansas City Breath Mints.</p>



<p><strong>Hatfield Suzuki</strong> claims the top spot in the voting, finishing Season 2 with the best ERA in ILB, the fourth-most strikeouts and the second-best WHIP (walks plus hits allowed per inning pitched). </p>



<p>They allowed only 13 walks all season, striking out 194 batters and allowing only 17 homers.</p>



<p>Their teammate, Plums Blather, was virtually as good as their award-winning teammate, leading the league in strikeouts and WHIP but allowing a few more home runs which must have broken the tie for several voters. </p>



<p>Either way, these two Mints were clearly the best pitchers in the league, and while only one could win, both should be proud of their accomplishments.</p>



<p>Rounding out the voting&#8217;s top three is Don Elliott of the resurgent Chicago Firefighters, who finished with the fourth-best ERA and allowed only six walks, leading to a K/BB ratio that ranked third in ILB.</p>



<p>Honorable mention also goes to Brisket Friendo of the Garages, who had the second best FIP in the league and struck out an impressive 209 batters, and Declan Suzanne of the Crabs, who had the second-best ERA in the splort.</p>

<h2>Postseason MVP Award</h2>



<p>As expected, the champion Sunbeams nearly swept the voting for Postseason MVP, with tide-turning grand slammer <strong>Guozhi Ong</strong> earning the most votes to claim the trophy. However, the award could have gone to any number of Beams, including Grizz El Sayed and Kajjala Aliyev for countless clutch hits, Dunn Keyes for a great performance on the mound in the final game, or any of the other Moab Hellmouth players listed in the chart above.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">Blaseball has returned, and so have the talented athletes who take to the Field every day and play the games. But not every player is equal. Some are better than others. Some are the best. We&#8217;re here to talk about the best.</p>



<p>Many thanks to Dargo4#2798 on Discord for organizing the first Most Valuable Player voting of the new era, which let a panel of Blaseball statisticians and observers vote on the best batters and pitchers of Season 1, plus the postseason MVP and some honorable mentions.</p>



<p>So without any more delay, here are the best players from Season 1 of the Coronation Era of Blaseball.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Copy_of_BNN_C1_MVP_Awards_Breakdowns-1.png?w=640&#038;ssl=1" alt="A list of players named in MVP voting is available at the bottom of the article." class="wp-image-2896" height="auto" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Copy_of_BNN_C1_MVP_Awards_Breakdowns-1.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Copy_of_BNN_C1_MVP_Awards_Breakdowns-1.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Copy_of_BNN_C1_MVP_Awards_Breakdowns-1.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Copy_of_BNN_C1_MVP_Awards_Breakdowns-1.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Copy_of_BNN_C1_MVP_Awards_Breakdowns-1.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Copy_of_BNN_C1_MVP_Awards_Breakdowns-1.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<h2>Best Batter Award</h2>



<p>Dargo&#8217;s panel named five players per ballot, and across 24 ballots, every single ballot contained one name: <strong>Fletcher Peck</strong>.</p>



<p>The Mexico City Wild Wings&#8217; batter finished with 24 home runs, tied for seventh in ILB, and a 1.234 OPS that was second among full-time players behind only Kiki Avci. </p>



<p>Peck also played sound defense, recording an out on over 78% of the balls hit in their direction, which ranks comfortably in the top half of ILB defenders.</p>



<p>Doing all of this as the league&#8217;s RBI leader and second-best run scorer was more than enough to cement their status as the near-consensus MVP of the first season of the era.</p>



<h2>Anastasia Isarobot Memorial Best Pitcher Award</h2>



<p>The winner of the first Best Pitcher Award of the era is also the new namesake for the award, as they will be honored posthumously after being the target of an incineration by the Umpires following the opening of the Forbidden Book in the Season 1 elections.</p>



<p><strong>Anastasia Isarobot</strong> was the only pitcher to top 200 strikeouts in Season 1, finishing with a 2.24 ERA and a 17-1 record on the mound. They also issued only four walks, the second-lowest total in the league behind Randy Dennis of the Flowers.</p>



<p>Isarobot was a star in the league and their talents will be missed, but their legacy lives on through this award.</p>



<h2>BNN Postseason MVP Award</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/BNN_Anastasia_Isarobot_Memorial_Best_Pitcher_Award_-_Coronation_S1.png?w=640&#038;ssl=1" alt="A list of players named in MVP voting is available at the bottom of the article." class="wp-image-2897" height="auto" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/BNN_Anastasia_Isarobot_Memorial_Best_Pitcher_Award_-_Coronation_S1.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/BNN_Anastasia_Isarobot_Memorial_Best_Pitcher_Award_-_Coronation_S1.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/BNN_Anastasia_Isarobot_Memorial_Best_Pitcher_Award_-_Coronation_S1.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/BNN_Anastasia_Isarobot_Memorial_Best_Pitcher_Award_-_Coronation_S1.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/BNN_Anastasia_Isarobot_Memorial_Best_Pitcher_Award_-_Coronation_S1.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/BNN_Anastasia_Isarobot_Memorial_Best_Pitcher_Award_-_Coronation_S1.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>While the Wild Wings sweep the Regular Season awards, it was the Shoe Thieves who snuck into the Internet Series and ran away with the victory.</p>



<p>With that in mind, it was their unlikely hero, Ankle Halifax, who gets the nod as Postseason MVP. With several clutch hits in the Post Season, including multiple home runs in the Internet Series and the Series-deciding hit to win it all for Charleston, they stood out ahead of teammate Penelope Berkowitz, who provided world-class defense for the Thieves throughout the playoffs.</p>



<h2>Honorable Mentions</h2>



<p>Your guess is as good as ours, but here are some players the panel wished to shout out!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/C1_MVP_HMs-1.png?w=640&#038;ssl=1" alt="A list of players named in MVP voting is available at the bottom of the article." class="wp-image-2898" height="auto" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/C1_MVP_HMs-1.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/C1_MVP_HMs-1.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/C1_MVP_HMs-1.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/C1_MVP_HMs-1.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/C1_MVP_HMs-1.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/C1_MVP_HMs-1.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>

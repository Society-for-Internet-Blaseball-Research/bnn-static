<p></p>



<p><strong>Clip Clipperson (it/its): </strong>“Reporting for BNN, I’m Clip Clipperson. Here with me is the Commissioner of the hit Discord event, Blaseball Mafia, New Mafia Commissioner Spiderface II!”</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>Spiderface II (she/her): </strong>“Hi!”</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>C: </strong>&#8220;So, New Mafia Commissioner Spiderface II, can you give us a little bit about yourself? Experience with Blaseball and the community, experience with hidden role games such as Mafia?&#8221;</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>S:</strong> &#8220;Sure. I&#8217;m a stay at home mom of two (rabbits), wife of six (and counting) and I write either as a hobby or professionally, depending on how I feel about myself when someone asks. My professional background is in theatre, education, and theatrical education. I&#8217;ve been with Blaseball since just before the birth of SCORES BASERUNNER, and a Flowers rep since about a year ago. As you might expect, most of my focus in terms of community management work in Blaseball has been centered around events and interteam relations. I live in Toronto, Ontario.&#8221;</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>&#8220;As far as experience with hidden role games, I&#8217;m the best Among Us player in The Garden. Ask anyone, they&#8217;ll tell you it&#8217;s true. And if they tell you something different, they&#8217;re <em>lying</em>.&#8221;</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>C:</strong> &#8220;Oh, wonderful! Certainly nothing &#8216;sus&#8217; about that. May you, your six wives (and counting), and two (rabbits) have continued happiness and healthiness!&#8221;</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>&#8220;What inspired you to suggest Mafia to the Groundskeepers? The large scale of the game, the game design of using Blaseball&#8217;s iconography and systems?&#8221;</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>S: </strong>&#8220;In truth, I honestly don&#8217;t really know. Looking at the logs, it seems as though I was chatting with other reps about like, Among Us Blaseball mods or an Among Us Blaseball tournament, and the idea just kinda came to me in a flash. I&#8217;m a very community minded person (which extends from my real life philosophy and experience) and so as soon as the seed of the idea was planted in me it really flourished quickly. I think most of the broad details were figured out in a couple days.</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>As far as the design of the event, using Blaseball iconography just seemed like a perfect fit- there were so many concepts already in Blaseball that translated super well, like revocation, debt and incineration, there are Blaseball Detectives and Fool Detectives&#8230; and then from there, it was a natural fit to slip in broader Blaseball mechanics, like Divine Favor or the concept of a Wimdy. It all really came together nicely, I think.&#8221;</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>C:</strong> &#8220;It certainly was the talk of the Discord! Did you have any pre-Mafia expectations about how the game would go, how the community and Groundskeepers would engage with it? If so, how were those expectations supported or upended?&#8221;</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>S: </strong>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why, but for some reason I didn&#8217;t expect it to be so&#8230; big! I honestly did not think that the players would be as chatty and passionate as they were, or that there would be so many spectators who were so invested. In retrospect, I should have expected that- it&#8217;s Blaseball, after all, we love a spectator splort- and certain design decisions, like having three Champions per team (which is a decision I stand by) certainly increased the busyness, especially early. I don&#8217;t think much about the broad structure would change if we (myself and the keepers) had expected it to be as much as it was, but we maybe would have been a little better prepared early.&#8221;</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>C:</strong> &#8220;Especially in the early Days, it did feel like Blaseball was back, to an extent, watching our favorite Teams and all. Speaking of the Teams, would you like to walk me through the process of distributing roles and alignments? Any that didn&#8217;t make the cut?&#8221;</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>S: </strong>&#8220;The role set of the game was probably the thing that had the most tweaking done and took the longest to iron out. I started by doing a bunch of research into Mafia in general, and hand picking a small selection of roles that both looked fun and had a clear Blaseball mod counterpart. I think the opening setup looked something like Stronger Together (who had a night chat at this point) Hard Boiled, Scrambled (who at this point got a random result from investigating) Fire Eater and Protector, Barista and Observed, and Early to the Party. That was it!”</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>“Then, I consulted my Mafia Advisors, Notes and Chaos my beloved, and we tweaked some existing roles, added all the Levil roles, and added Elsewhere. Then, almost a week before we locked in, Ump Possum came in and added Electric and Magnified as a final balance tweak. Honestly, I don&#8217;t think anything ever actually got cut! We certainly had some things we mused over and decided against, but for the most part, once a role was in it stayed in. Then, I had 24 role/alignment pairs, and just assigned each team a pair!&#8221;</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>C:</strong> &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard word that you had a special process to assign teams roles, it sounds Smashing.&#8221;</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>S: </strong>&#8220;All I&#8217;ll say is that the Breath Mints were Luigi, and that whatever method I may have used, it was, as so often happens in Blaseball, a far better storyteller than I. Some of the role assignments were pitch perfect.&#8221;</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>C: </strong>“Definitely, the Jazz Hands and Moist Talkers&#8217; rivalry represented as Baristas and Observed respectively was a personal favorite of mine. What are your, let&#8217;s say, top 3 moments or events from Mafia as a whole?&#8221;</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>S:</strong> &#8220;Hmm, it&#8217;s difficult to say, honestly, especially since the perspective I was watching the game from- knowing absolutely everything- was so much different from everyone else&#8217;s. Definitely the first reveal of Divine Favor was a real highlight. Didn&#8217;t the Garages then proceed to win 3 tie votes off of Divine Favor in a row? That&#8217;s just awesome.  Watching the Lift masterfully manipulate the Firefighters every night before dramatically throwing it all away was a favorite. And watching the Lovers (Val in particular, not that I&#8217;m biased <strong>[Editor&#8217;s Note: Val is one of Spiderface&#8217;s wives]</strong>) run an absolute clinic de-susing themselves after the Flowers died and using Friend of Crows in an ingenious and completely unexpected way was fantastic.&#8221;</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;You might be able to tell from those that I may have had a slight bias towards Levil winning.&#8221;</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>C:</strong> &#8220;Haha, of course. Can you describe the experience of running the game while it was active? It seemed like the running and playing of the game over several weeks might have been taxing.&#8221;</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>S: </strong>&#8220;It was! I essentially scheduled my whole life around Mafia, hammering my sleep schedule into shape in order to wake up in time to do the writeup each day. I had put myself in a funny position where I was one part writer, one part producer, and one part supporting actor, and it was an interesting task balancing all of those things. I was very hyperfocused on Mafia all the time in the early game- at one point I almost got hit by a car on my bike while thinking about potential strategies the Jazz Hands could use to win.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Learning how to take breaks and keep a healthy Mafia/Life balance was crucial, and I owe a lot to the keepers for helping me with that. Especially Notes and Chaos, who did great work as Intern Interim Mafia Commissioner and Senior Intern Interim Mafia Commissioner respectively while I couldn&#8217;t be around to judge a rules question or do a writeup.&#8221;</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>C:</strong> &#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear you had some great help with you, and doubly glad you didn&#8217;t get hit by a car. Are there any changes you and/or your associates would make for future Discord events as such? I also suppose, do you have any advice for folks that want to plan Discord events, small or large?&#8221;</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>S:</strong> &#8220;Hmm, that is a good question. I could talk a lot about minor structural changes that could have happened- slowmodes and day durations and such- but I think my main thing I would have done different, which applies to most events, is just done a better job at setting expectations of what the event was. It was called Blaseball Discord Mafia, and the Blaseball and Discord parts were just as important as the Mafia. It definitely, indisputably, was a game of Mafia, but that ultimately came second to the fact that it was a community event about building bonds and keeping each other entertained. Improv with extra steps, as I like to say.”</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>“And so the thing that I wish I had done better, that I recommend to anyone organizing any community event, is to set expectations clearly, and early. I won&#8217;t pretend that we didn&#8217;t have a few genuine rough patches early on, and I think a lot of that came down to that expectations around what the event was for and what the event would be like were just not set correctly. And that is totally my bad, and is a mistake I aim to learn a lot from.&#8221;</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>C:</strong> &#8220;Well put. Anything else you&#8217;d like to comment on? Future plans in Blaseball, community management, Short Circuits, etc.?&#8221;</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>S:</strong> &#8220;Oh goodness, is it over already? Well, currently I&#8217;m just gently relaxing with the Lovers, enjoying Short Circuits from a distance. I&#8217;ll probably go back to being a Flowers rep eventually ‒ I well and truly love this community and running events in it, so while I&#8217;m recuperating from the immensity of Mafia right now, I&#8217;ll be back at it soon enough, I suspect. Stay tuned for whatever monstrosity I come up with next, assuming the keepers ever allow me to do anything ever again.”</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>“As far as closing words, I&#8217;ve already thanked everyone who participated in every way- so I&#8217;ll thank them again! Thank you all, Champions, spectators, keepers, all my various collaborators, Carl, for your participation in Blaseball Discord Mafia. I truly just don&#8217;t know what to say about it, it was so much that I have trouble wrapping my head around it. But thank you for being there with me.”</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>“And finally, if you enjoyed Blaseball Discord Mafia, remember that it came from very humble origins! Just a single errant modmail is sometimes all it takes to spiral a cool idea into a beautiful reality. Meaning, that you can do it too! Not Mafia specifically, but whatever YOUR dream community event is. I so often feel like I&#8217;m the most proactive person in a given room, and I&#8217;m giving YOU all the task of proving me wrong. I don&#8217;t hope you&#8217;re looking forward to whatever I&#8217;ll make happen next. I hope you&#8217;re all looking forward to whatever YOU make happen next. I know I certainly am.&#8221;</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>&#8220;That being said I&#8217;m happy to announce my next major project, Blaseball Discord [CONNECTION LOST]&#8221;</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>C:</strong> &#8220;Spider? Spider!? Must be the Noise. Back to you, BNN.&#8221;</p>



<p></p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #fa8a10; font-family: Lora;"><b>The Final Countdown</b></span></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #fa8a10; font-family: Lora;"><b>Levil Teams Claim Victory!</b></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora;">MAFIA IS MAYHEM!</span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><strong>QUICK HITS FROM THE IMMATERIAL PLANE</strong></span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>Shock and Claw</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Baltimore Crabs were the next victim of the Levil Teams. The Crabs had successfully utilized their Electric Blood to zap away the Votes of Levil Teams several days in a row. With the numbers of Teams dwindling they had become a thorn in the side of Levil that could no longer be ignored, so it was time for the Crabs to Ascend. Or just Incinerated. Crabs Glood? Crabs Levil? Crabs Dead.
</span></span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>Eye Spy a Sus Team</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;">As desperation kicked in the League became deeply Divided. The Chicago Firefighters and Yellowstone Magic proposed the Houston Spies as Levil, whilst the Moist Talkers and Spies argued they should Revoke the Seattle Garages. Rampant Speculation took place over the Day, would the Baltimore Crabs have been able to zap away a Vote before they were Incinerated? As Sun (X) sank below the Horizon the question was answered. The Houston Spies had 3 Votes, and the Seattle Garages had 2. Naturally, the Breckenridge Jazz Hands had lodged their single Vote for the Canada Moist Talkers. When the Votes were Counted, the result was a Tie between the Spies and Garages. The Garages superior Divine Favor saved the Day for a second time, and the Spies were Revoked revealing a… Glood Team!?</span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>The Magic Goes Away</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Weather a miracle has occurred! The unending streak of Solar Eclipses has been bro- oh. Sorry. The Weather Radar had Tuned into some other Season. The Yellowstone Magic were the final Team to be Incinerated during the Night. Despite their name implying otherwise the Magic had no special Role, much to the chagrin of their Champions. In the end they weren’t Incinerated for potentially holding a Role, nor even for being a leadership figure to the Glood Teams. They were Incinerated because they were a Normal Team doing Glood Things, and since the last Levil Team needed the Moist Talkers and Jazz Hands to be alive they were left to choose between the Chicago Firefighters and the Yellowstone Magic. Ultimately they chose to rob the League of its Magic.</span></span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>Foreclosure</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;">The Sun (X) rose and the Final Day began. The Breckenridge Jazz Hands stood up, and openly called out to the Seattle Garages to support them, to which the Garages responded with a powerful declaration of “Revoke Canada Moist Talkers”. The Moist Talkers and Chicago Firefighters fired back and Voted to Revoke the Seattle Garages, tying things up. With no further action to take until the Day ended, the Teams chose to spend the rest of it having fun and reminiscing over the past several weeks of Mafia. In the end the Game came down to Fate, and was decided by Divine Favor. The Canada Moist Talkers had an extremely Glood Divine Favor of 5, but the Seattle Garages had a Divine Favor of 3, meaning the Vote ended with the Moist Talkers Revoked. Now Revealed as Baristas the Jazz Hands<strong> [REDACTED]</strong> the Observed Moist Talkers and escaped into the Secret Base securing their Win.</span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>Chained Together</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;">The Seattle Garages and the Chicago Firefighters were the last two teams left, so, Game Over. Well, not quite. The Seattle Garages were still too close to the Firefighters when they were Incinerated. So for the first time the Instability Chained&#8230;right back to the Garages, who were promptly Incinerated by a Rogue Ump, and their Debt Collected. Now left alone in the League the Hellmouth Sunbeams exited Party Time and made a clean sweep of the Season 200X Internet Series. Don’t worry, there’s no need to fear about the Fate of Internet League Blaseball. The ever helpful Monitor has granted Teams permission to play in the Trench, marking the end of Mafia, and the Creation of the first ever Season of Trench League Blaseball.</span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>CONGRATULATIONS!</b></span></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;">Congratulations to the Hellmouth Sunbeams and the Breckenridge Jazz Hands for also Winning Mafia but as Neultral Teams!  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Week started with the League down to 13 Teams, with 4 Debts remaining among us. The Debted Teams couldn’t afford to let the Hardboiled LA Unlimited Tacos live any longer and so they Paid the Ultimate Price during Night 6. The Tacos dramatic reveal at the end of Day 5 had saved the Chicago Firefighters, and then chained into Revoking the Levil Atlantis Georgias and San Francisco Lovers one after the other. Without their leadership and guidance will the Glood Teams fall apart?</span></span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>Gotta Had it to them</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;">The Breckenridge Jazz Hands added their name to the list of Teams making Claims. In order to undercut suspicions aimed at them, the Jazz Hands announced that they were the second Neultral Team, and that their Win condition was to Revoke the Canada Moist Talkers. The Moist Talkers, who famously do not know what their Role does, felt the Claim fit with what they knew about their Role and chose to believe the Jazz Hands. A Bargain was struck between the League and the Jazz Hands. If possible the League will ask the Moist Talkers for Forgiveness and then Revoke them. In Return the Jazz Hands will assist in eliminating the Levil Teams. Naturally, the Jazz Hands will just as easily betray the League if it will help them achieve their goal. &nbsp;</span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>Thanks it has Pockets</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Revoking two Levil Teams, the Miami Dale looked to extend the streak to a third and complete a Hat Trick. The Baltimore Crabs and Canada Moist Talkers stood by their side to try and eliminate the Tokyo Lift. The Lift had been using Elsewhere to befriend and scramble the Chicago Firefighters. When the Lift became the top choice for Revoking the Firefighters were resistant to the idea, and instead looked to Revoke the Breckenridge Jazz Hands. Thanks to the Baltimore Crabs’ Vote Suppression the Vote was tied between the two, setting the Day for an electrifying finish. The Dale convinced the Yellowstone Magic to Change sides, and they broke the tie. To the absolute devastation of the Chicago Firefighters the Lift admitted their guilt, telling the Firefighters they had been using them as fall guys. With a clear confession the League easily Revoked the Tokyo Lift, and their Debt was Relieved.</span></span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>Zapped Away</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;">In Weather, the streak of Solar Eclipses has continued unimpeded, along with the unbroken chain of Team Incinerations at the hands of Rogue Umpires. Words were no longer enough to Deal with the Miami Dale, the most Valuable Players in the Game, so the Debted Teams had them Incinerated. The Dale had caused quite the ruckus, and were in the process of Consolidating the Glood Teams together and giving the League a Guaranteed Win. They say you can’t leave anything behind when you die, but the Dale left behind ‘The Chart’ listing the Teams they believed to be the Debt Holders, now the only thing left to do is see if their prediction will come to pass. </span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>Down and Out</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;">A Night Shift had impacted the Core Mechanics, swapping out one Champion for another. The two Champions held drastically different playstyles, and the new erratic style caused suspicion to land on the Mechs. Further examination of the Mechs Voting patterns made the situation worse. The Mechanics were also one of the Teams listed on the Dale’s Chart to Revoke, the combination of factors sent them to the top of the list of suspects. The League couldn’t resist another nail biting finish, and ultimately the Core Mechanics joined the Atlantis Georgias, San Francisco Lovers, and Tokyo Lift in admitting their guilt and allowed themselves to be Revoked gracefully.</span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>The Death Mints</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;">The Breath Mints were the first proper Role Claim, and they even backed it up with proof! The Kansas City Breath Mints Claimed at the beginning of Day 2 that they had a power that meant their Votes counted for double, and then showed it off by Voting for themselves. They had courted Incineration Day after Day, but every Night the Levil Teams always felt that there was someone just a bit more threatening. But with the total number of Teams dropping into single digits it was time for the Breath Mints to go, and the Levil Teams provided them a swift entry into the Town Hall.</span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>Tie Died</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;">Day Nine dawned over the League, signalling the start of yet another chaotic day. With only two Debts remaining the Levil Teams chances of victory were shrinking rapidly. The Ohio Worms made a large move, Claiming a Role often called a ‘Medium’ &#8211; that is, they Claimed that they could talk to Deceased Glood Teams. Despite a small chance of success it seemed that some of the last Teams were willing to believe the spurious Claims, and the Day was spent with Teams suspicions divided between the Houston Spies, Ohio Worms, and Seattle Garages. When the Yellowstone Magic saw three Votes for the Worms and three for the Garages they gave up on pushing the Spies and swapped their Vote to the Ohio Worms to try and avoid a tie, forgetting about the Crabs ability to Suppress a Vote. When reached for comment the Crabs Champions had this to say “oh god what no”. The Day Closed with the actual Votes for the Worms and Garages tied at 3. Fans went wild speculating about the process for breaking ties. Mafia operates on Blaseball Rules, and that means ties are broken via Divine Favor. The Garages had a Divine Favor of 3 and the Worms’ was 12. The Worms couldn’t worm their way out of this one and were Revoked. The Reveal confirmed Fan Theories as the Ohio Worms Debt was Relieved and their Negative Mod was displayed for all to see, which had allowed them to appear as Glood when Investigated.</span></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;">Now it is Gods’ Night, the very last Gods’ Night. Seven Teams Remain, and there is only one Debt among us. Can the last Levil Team Claim victory from the jaws of defeat, or will the Glood Teams Close it out? Will the Breckenridge Jazz Hands succeed in Revoking the Canada Moist Talkers? There’s only one way to find out, and that’s to continue Tuning In.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Boston <del>Flowers</del> Flours confident play style garnered suspicion over the first three days, most notably for leading the Charge against the Neultral Hellmouth Sunbeams. The League was Surprised on Day 4 to find the Flours had been Incinerated overnight, proving them to have been Glood all along. They were also Revealed to be Hard Boiled, a Mod that allows a Team to Investigate another Team&#8217;s Alignment- with the downside that they may be Scrambled and always Receive incorrect Results. But the Flours didn’t leave the League Empty-Handed in their search for the Debted Teams. They left behind a Secret Message known as the “Egg Code&#8221;. The Code contained hints to the nature of their Role and the Results of past Investigations by dropping references to “Eggs” in their messages. Boston should have counted their chickens before they hatched, because the Message had been deciphered by a Levil Team, leading to their Incineration.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San Francisco Lovers claimed to be behind the mysterious Birds seen watching over the Canada Moist Talkers, and on Day 3, the Hawaiʻi Fridays. The Lovers stated that their Feathered Friends witnessed the Fridays not take action during the Night. Feeling that the Hawaiʻi Fridays Vibes were wrong, the League pressed the matter, placing down Votes as proof of their intent. Now under Pressure, the Fridays began to flounder and failed to mount a defence as reality Sank in. Ultimately, they decided it was Island Time to go, and Trusted the San Francisco Lovers, deciding that their Revocation would provide proof of the Lovers innocence to the other Teams. In the end, it was Revealed they were a Normal Team with a Glood Alignment.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Weather, the Sun Block has proven an incredible Asset for the League. The increased rate of Solar Eclipses at Night has resulted in an Outstanding Change to Debt Repayments. The Hades Tigers were one of the more recent victims, their habit of Never Looking Back letting them be taken by Surprise by the Debted Teams, leading to their death. One would be forgiven for thinking the Tigers died for the crime of interacting with the Flours as they left behind the Egg Code, but their fate was only Sealed when the Debted Teams began to suspect the Tigers of holding the Fire Eater Mod. Incinerations and Debt Repayments are Set to continue following the Loss of the Tigers, and the Leagues Creditors could not be satisfied with all the Riches of Hades.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Day 5 the League turned to Chaos with accusations being slung around like snow in a snowball fight. The Chicago Firefighters took aim at the Philadelphia Pies, who in Turn took aim at the Atlantis Georgias, with the Firefighters being Targets themselves and the Baltimore Crabs holding their fair share of Votes. The Miami Dale were even voting for&#8230;the Miami Dale? The Fortunes of the League shifted during the final hour when the Los Angeles Unlimited Tacos Claimed that they were another Hardboiled Team. They believed that the Results of their Investigation had confirmed four Teams to be Glood &#8211; the Canada Moist Talkers, the Kansas City Breath Mints, the Philadelphia Pies, and the Ohio Worms. Votes were moved between Teams rapidly in response, and the Atlantis Georgias were narrowly Revoked over the Chicago Firefighters. In a Massive Win for the Glood Teams of the League, they had at long last successfully Revealed a Levil Team! It’s currently unknown if the Underhanded tactics used by the Georgias led to a successfully falsified Levil Result during an Investigation.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Los Angeles Unlimited Tacos weren&#8217;t the only team to make a dramatic reveal in the final moments of Day 5. The Dallas Steaks and Philadelphia Pies cooked up a plan to protect the Hardboiled Tacos by making themselves an even bigger target &#8211; by revealing that they were Stronger Together. The Steaks and Pies knew the others&#8217; Alignment but with the Cost that if one Team died, so would the other. Two Teams for the Price of one was a golden opportunity for the Levil Teams, who took the bait, buying the Tacos precious time to Investigate more Teams.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following on from their Win on Day 5, the Glood Teams made aggressive moves against the San Francisco Lovers. The Lovers had been heavily involved in the events leading to the Atlantis Georgias being Revoked. They were the cause of a false Role Claim, but had also been seen defending them. These actions had caused them to be accused previously, but they had easily Charmed their way out each time. They tried to Charm the League again- but this time, the writing was on the Wall, and they surrendered themselves to the inevitable. With a Massive 13 Votes, the Lovers were Revoked, and the mysterious Birds were Revealed to have been Crows. The Crows were sent to block other Teams’ attempts at using their Mods, and the claim made by the Georgias was meant to act as cover for the fact that the Crows had been directed to the Hades Tigers the Night they died. With two Levil Teams now Revoked back to back, who knows what Events will occur downstream? Will the Levil Teams complete their Debt Repayments? Or will the Glood Teams Revoke them first?</span></span></p>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;">In a, let’s be honest with ourselves, predictable move, the Mafia Champions opened Day 1 of Season 200X by attempting to circumvent the rules in any way possible. The Canada Moist Talkers suggested the League abstain from voting, and the Dallas Steaks cooked up a plan to Revoke the Deceased Toronto Condominiums. A Message from Ownership confirmed the invalidity of any votes for Deceased Teams, quickly proving the plan to be all sizzle and no steak.</span></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Lora;"><b>A Sole Read</b></span></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;">In Weather, the recently installed Sun Block has been protecting our favourite Teams and Players from the harmful effects of Suns during the Night by Eclipsing any and all Suns and/or Celestial Objects. The Debted Teams have taken full Advantage of the situation to help Repay their Debts. The Charleston Shoe Thieves were Ready and Willing to protect other Teams using their Fire Protector Mod, which allows them to be Incinerated instead of an Unstable Team. However the Shoe Thieves let the fact they had a Mod slip, and were promptly struck down by the Debted Teams.</span></p>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;">Rumours that the Hellmouth Sunbeams were “Sus” Reverberated through the Town Square on Day 2. Staring down their accusers, the Sunbeams Forged a new Message, bringing “message.txt” to the Masses. Despite a Ratings spike and the creation of Laughter, the League continued to Desert them, and the Hellmouth Sunbeams became the first Team to be Revoked. But the Sunbeams had the last Laugh when it was Revealed they were Early to the Party, a Mod that causes a Team to Win upon being Revoked. Their Victory proved why Fans should Never Estimate the Beams.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000; font-family: Lora; text-align: justify;">All That Glitter Weather wasn’t Gold when Day 3 began. The Mexico City Wild Wings had been Incinerated during the previous night, leaving behind a Leadership void, and Revealing the existence of Elsewhere; a Location where Elsewhere Teams can communicate privately during the Night. The Chicago Firefighters came forth to claim Membership, followed by the Tokyo Lift, and finally the New York Millennials. The League scrutinized the Mills&#8217; past behavior, and even with an Undertow threatening to pull the Crabs Under, the Current was too strong and the New York Millennials were Revoked. Unfortunately for the Glood Teams of the League, the Mills turned up to their Revoking 15 Minutes late with a Glood Reveal.</span></p>

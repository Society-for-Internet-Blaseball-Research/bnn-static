										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>By:<a href="http://twitter.com/emfring"> Em Fri</a>‚Äî I mean, <a href="http://twitter.com/joeytbadger">Joey T Badger</a></p>



<p>Happy Timezone Splortsfans! It‚Äôs me, Joey T Badger! You are probably used to hearing me yell my hubris to you, but this time, I, Joey T Badger, am writing all my hubris down. As I sit here, writing this down with my very Joey T Badger hands in my Joey T Badger booth, I know that I‚Äôll probably get some of these teams wrong. However, as Joey T Badger and no one else, that is all part of the fun of power ranking. You know what else is fun? Seeing all the new players we get to meet during each Short Circuit! So join us‚Äî and by us, I mean me, Joey T Badger, as we (me) find the best names and the best teams.</p>



<h2>These Teams Will Try Better Next Season</h2>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">24. Breckenridge Jazz Hands<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f450.png" alt="üëê" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>Squid Psst. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got. The Jands have some great names, but bad players.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">23. Seattle Garages<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f3b8.png" alt="üé∏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>Mmmmm‚Ä¶. Uh uh‚Ä¶ nuh-uh. We are back to Garages bad.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">22. San Francisco Lovers<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f48b.png" alt="üíã" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>Great names, not a great team. Lovers? Meh.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">21. Canada Moist Talkers<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f5e3.png" alt="üó£" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>Not impressed with the rotation or the lineup‚Äî not your season, Malkers, but the midseason tournament could turn things on their head.</p>



<h2><strong>Not Terrible But By No Means Good</strong></h2>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">20. Yellowstone Magic <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2728.png" alt="‚ú®" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>As Above So Below‚Äî but not terribly good. But the most important thing about this season‚Äôs Magic is Squid Broom. I mean, think about it. A squid with a bunch of tiny brooms? A broom but it is all squid tentacles helping you clean up? Any way you look at it, Squid Broom is perfect. So don‚Äôt pay attention to any other aspect of the Magic‚Äôs roster.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">19. Philly Pies<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f967.png" alt="ü•ß" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>Wolf Buss, Kid Darling. We have seen the Pies take the cake in the past, but this season, it looks like the closest they will get to the Finals is if the team hops in the Wolf Buss and takes a trip to the Championship Series.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">18. Hawai‚Äôi Fridays <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f3dd.png" alt="üèù" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>There are two ways to get to my (Joey T Badger) heart, blueberries and alliteration. Unfortunately, even the alliterations of power hitter Rumi Raspberry and Mooch McGhee in the shadows won&#8217;t save them from their rotation.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">17. Core Mechanics<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f6e0.png" alt="üõ†" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>Toby Topaz, a great name. Mechanics seem consistent with their bats, alright on the mound. They seem decent, but nowhere near the best.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">16. Mexico City Wild Wings<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f357.png" alt="üçó" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>Badger Le√≥n, I mean, <em>come on</em>. They have a few good players split between the rotation and lineup, but there isn‚Äôt enough talent to take them to the top.</p>



<h2><strong>Some Good Teams</strong></h2>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">15. Tokyo Lift<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f3cb.png" alt="üèã" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the Lift‚Äôs Rotation, you may find yourself overcome by the suaveness of Art Demb√©l√© or charmed by Craggy Toad. But the (Seth) Bitter(s) reality of just how bad the Rotation locks in the Lift this low.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">14. Hades Tigers<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f405.png" alt="üêÖ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>If you want to know what I‚Äôm thinking about the Tigers, just take a look at Calvin Clown. On the surface, you‚Äôve got a fun, alliterative name. But look a little closer, and you see abysmal stars. A silly little honking guy can‚Äôt save the Tigers from themselves.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">13. New York Millennials<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f4f1.png" alt="üì±" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>This season‚Äôs New York Millennials are nothing if not consistent. However, they are consistently Not The Best. If they can‚Äôt turn it around before the playoffs, they‚Äôll be needing some hugs from shadow player Hugs Izquierda.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">12. Baltimore Crabs<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f980.png" alt="ü¶Ä" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>Someone said that Thomas John was a ‚Äúreference‚Äù to ‚ÄúBaseball.‚Äù I do not know what that means. They have potential this season, but relative to some of the other teams, a championship doesn&#8217;t seem likely. Nevertheless, the Crabs always seem to pull it off in the end, so they could win it all against the odds.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">11. Dallas Steaks<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f969.png" alt="ü•©" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>Jawn Humblebee. Honk Olson. Alford Friggin. The Dallas Steaks are clearly the best team in the league‚Ä¶ name-wise at least. On a skill and star level? There is not enough consistency in the roaster for the Steaks to take home the trophy.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">10. LA Unlimited Tacos<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f32e.png" alt="üåÆ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>Chug Shaw‚Ä¶ just like my feelings about that name, it&#8217;s fun to think about, but I am not convinced by it. Just like the name Chug Shaw, the Tacos will be OK.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">9. Hellmouth Sunbeams<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f31e.png" alt="üåû" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>I‚Äôll do it, I‚Äôll estimate the ‚ÄòBeams. They are not bad‚Äî in fact, I‚Äôll say it, the beams are good!</p>



<h2><strong>Playoff Bound</strong></h2>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">8. Chicago Firefighters<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f525.png" alt="üî•" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>The Firefighters are not bad per se, but compared to some of the other teams in the league this circuit, they are not the best. Maybe, just maybe, they can (Steals) Waltz into the postseason with some luck.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">7. Ohio Worms<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f40c.png" alt="üêå" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>Oh, Worm?</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">6. Miami Dale<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f6a4.png" alt="üö§" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>Snake Johns boasts a measly 2-star rating, but the rest of the Dale does not disappoint. Plus, with a name like Snake Johns, you can‚Äôt be that mad at them.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">5. Houston Spies<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f575.png" alt="üïµ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>Kumar is going to shut it down, and Goodman is going to seal the win shut. Spies ||good.||</p>



<h2><strong>Champions to Be</strong></h2>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">4. Charleston Shoe Thieves <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f45f.png" alt="üëü" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>A strong lineup, but a weaker rotation. I can picture the Thieves stealing their way up to the playoffs, but realistically, they‚Äôre more likely to find themselves just bumped out by another team just as the postseason is in sight. But they have Jumpy Joseph, and I‚Äôll give them extra points for that.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">3.Kansas City Breath Mints<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f36c.png" alt="üç¨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>Mints Goo.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">2. Atlantis Georgias<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f531.png" alt="üî±" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>Apparently, the Georgias are mad at me, Joey T Badger, because I ranked them low last time. Today, I rank them higher. Their star ratings are some of the highest, and with Orb Dove‚Äôs pregame motivational speeches, the Georgias may be able to go all the way.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">1. Boston Flowers<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f339.png" alt="üåπ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>



<p>Oh Hello, Boston Flowers‚Ä¶ a great team, my great team‚Äî no, OUR great team. Not only do we have one of the best-named players in the league, Bird Carr, but we also have the bats and pitchers to back them up. From this completely unbiased voice, totally not affiliated with the Flowers at all, I think the Flowers have a real shot at the Championship.</p>

<p>Blaseballers across this material plane are waking up and getting ready for Season 23 of Internet League Blaseball after a much-needed Siesta. If you have been away from Blaseball for a while or just need a refresher, then BNN Sunday is the program for you.</p>



<p>This week, meet BNN Board members <a href="http://twitter.com/catstlats">Cat</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/leto">Dan</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/emfring">Em</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/thesplortshub">Joey</a> as they discuss Blaseball News Network <a href="http://patreon.com/blaseballnews">happenings</a> and recap Season 22. What do the new Suns do? What have collective action and a lot of Pickled Herring revealed in The Library? What does the Coin mean by &#8220;Rising Stars?&#8221; They even explain the newest addition to the BNN Power Rankings: The Hubris Metric. Learn what all of this means (and maybe find BNN) with this Season&#8217;s BNN Sunday. </p>
